Data Structures:
- ArrayLists
- HashTables
- Trees
- Graphs
- Stacks / Queues
- Heaps

Concepts:
- Big O: To get the runtime of an algorithm 
  > drop constans
  > sum steps
  > nested loops for same input O(N^2)
  > nested loops for diff input O(N * P)
  > fibo O(2^K)
  
- Recursion
- Memoization / Dyanmic programming
